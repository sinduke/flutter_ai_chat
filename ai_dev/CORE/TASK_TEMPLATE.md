## Validation Notes

`aidev check` validates task structure against this template.

Use `Status: example` for reference tasks that demonstrate the workflow but were
not executed in the current repository. Example tasks should still include the
full task shape so they can be copied into real projects safely.

Completed tasks must include Review Plan, Verification Gates, Index Updates, and
Completion Evidence.
